      The BMW M6 GT3 marks the new spearhead of BMW Motorsport sales. Meticulous
      work was put in to fine-tune the BMW M6 Coupé, which formed the basis for
      the new car and was already perfectly suited to outings on the racetrack.
      Fully focustd on performance, the body is entirely made out of carbon
      fiber. Distinctive elements such as splitter, diffuser and rear wing
      demonstrate the efficient aerodynamics. Crash structures made from carbon
      fiber in the front and rear section are designed for maximum safety. The
      center-oriented driver’s seat position and the long wheelbase make driving
      the BMW M6 GT3 an unique experience in the world of motor racing.

      “This is a big moment for everyone who has worked so intensely and
      passionately on the development of the BMW M6 GT3 in recent months. This
      car incorporates all the experience we have gained in recent years on the
      endurance and GT racing circuits. We are well on schedule with the
      development and are confident we will be able to take to the track in 2016
      with a package that is competitive from the outset. We still have a lot of
      work ahead of us, but I would like to take this opportunity to say a big
      thank you to everyone who has been involved with this fantastic project.”
      As Marquardt stated, the M6 GT3 encompasses drastic improvements in
      technology, performance, and economy. Utilizing the essence of the
      Motorsports development, the new M6 GT3 is even more aerodynamic and
      powerful than its predecessor. With its custom tuned M TwinPower
      Turbocharged engine, transaxle drive concept, long wheelbase, and
      lightweight design, the high-performance work-of-art can be seen tearing
      up the tracks and snatching up trophies all around the world.
